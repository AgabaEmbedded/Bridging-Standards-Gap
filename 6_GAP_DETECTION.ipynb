    "# Agentic RAG Chat System for Telecommunication Standards Training\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the creation of an **agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chat system** using **Langchain** and a pre-existing **Pinecone** vector database. The purpose of this system is to act as a **training agent for telecommunication standard contributors**, allowing them to query the database and receive answers based on relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is configured to use:\n",
    "- A **Pinecone** database named \"telecom-rag-index\" for storing and retrieving document embeddings.\n",
    "- The **'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'** embedding model for vectorizing queries and documents.\n",
    "- An **open-source Mistral language model** (`EYEDOL/teleLLM` via HuggingFacePipeline) for generating human-like responses based on retrieved information.\n",
    "- A **Langchain agent** that orchestrates the process, deciding when to use a tool (in this case, a RAG tool) to answer user queries.\n",
    "- A **custom RAG tool** that queries the Pinecone database and retrieves the top 3 relevant document chunks.\n",
    "- A **simple chat interface** for user interaction, which also displays the source documents used to generate the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook walks through the steps of:\n",
    "1. Installing necessary libraries.\n",
    "2. Initializing the connection to Pinecone and connecting to the specific index.\n",
    "3. Setting up the embedding model and the language model.\n",
    "4. Creating the RAG retriever and wrapping the RAG process as an agent tool.\n",
    "5. Defining and initializing the Langchain agent with the RAG tool.\n",
    "6. Implementing a chat loop to interact with the agent, including displaying retrieved source documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system serves as a foundation for a conversational AI that can provide information and training on telecommunication standards by leveraging a domain-specific knowledge base stored in Pinecone."

To resolve this, I will modify the agent initialization to provide a dummy tool or use an agent type that does not strictly require tools. A simpler approach might be to just use the LLM directly with a structured prompt within the `run_synthesiser_agent` function, bypassing the `initialize_agent` structure if no complex tool use is needed for synthesis. Given the requirement to *implement the agent's logic using `langchain.agents.initialize_agent`*, I will add a simple dummy tool to satisfy the requirement of the `ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION` agent type. This dummy tool will not perform any complex action but will allow the agent to be initialized. I will then redefine the agent and the `run_synthesiser_agent` function.\n",
