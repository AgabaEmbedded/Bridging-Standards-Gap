# 🌐 TechRangers AI-Native Standards Support System  
### FG-AINN-I Build-a-thon 2025 Submission  

## 📖 Overview

This project presents an **AI-native, multi-agent orchestration system** developed by **Team TechRangers** for the **FG-AINN-I Build-a-thon 2025**. Our system is designed to **bridge the standardization gap** in 6G telecommunications by enabling automated gap detection and contribution support for underrepresented regions—particularly across Africa.

Our system builds a transparent, intelligent, and semantically enriched infrastructure for standards contribution using autonomous agents, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM), and a multimodal knowledge base powered by vector embeddings and semantic search.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Enable inclusive and region-aware participation in 6G standardization.
- Identify gaps in ITU-T 6G standards using AI-native methods.
- Provide a scalable, autonomous, and user-friendly environment for new and existing contributors.
- Drastically reduce technical and procedural entry barriers.

---

## 🧩 System Architecture & Components

### 🔍 AI-Powered Multimodal Knowledge Base

- Ingests ITU-T standard documents across formats: **text, tables, images, and audio**.
- Clause-level segmentation and metadata tagging (e.g., *region*, *energy*, *rural*).
- Stored in a **Pinecone** vector database for **semantic and hybrid search**.
- Automatically updated via **OCR**, **transcription**, and **embedding refresh** pipelines.

### 🧠 Multi-Agent Architecture (Built with LangChain)

| Agent Name     | Role                                                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cartographer** | Performs topic modeling and document summarization.                  |
| **Analyst**       | Performs clause comparison to detect outdated or missing content.    |
| **Hypothesiser**  | Proposes testable questions regarding suspected standard gaps.       |
| **Verifier**      | Validates gaps using semantic search and contextual correlation.     |
| **Synthesiser**   | Compiles findings into structured reports and recommendations.       |
| **Training Chat Agent** | Guides new contributors with simplified explanations and walkthroughs.|

### 🤖 Specialized LLM Pipeline

- **Base Models:** Mistral 7B, Llama 3.23B  
- **Embedding Models:** Jina V4, ImageBind  
- **Techniques:** Continued pretraining on domain-specific corpora (ITU-T, African policy docs), followed by LoRA fine-tuning for:
  - Gap detection  
  - Compliance alignment  
  - Regional relevance  
  - Summarization and explanation

## ✅ Proof-of-Concept: Tests and Results

### 🧪 TEST-1: Knowledge Base Ingestion

- Preprocess ITU-T documents into structured formats.
- Embed clause-level documents semantically with metadata.
- Ensure accurate, fast, and ontology-linked semantic search.

📌 **Success Criteria:**
- All documents correctly parsed and indexed.
- Metadata tags (e.g., *energy*, *rural coverage*) accurately applied.

---

### 🧪 TEST-2: Agentic Gap Detection

- Detect missing or underspecified areas in 6G standards.
- Emphasize underserved problems (e.g., rural power stability in Africa).
- Output structured gap reports with evidence and contribution suggestions.

📌 **Success Criteria:**
- Output is verifiable and matches known regional challenges.
- Recommendations are aligned with ITU contribution formats.
