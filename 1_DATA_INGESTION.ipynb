    "The previous attempt encountered errors when processing tables, specifically \"sequence item 1: expected str instance, NoneType found\". This indicates that some cells in the extracted tables might contain `None` instead of strings, causing issues when creating the DataFrame or normalizing cell content. Additionally, there are `FutureWarning` and `UserWarning` about `applymap` deprecation and non-unique columns when converting to dictionary. The code needs to handle potential `None` values gracefully during DataFrame creation and normalization, use the recommended `map` instead of `applymap`, and address the non-unique columns issue if necessary (although `to_dict('records')` usually handles this by keeping the last column with a duplicate name). Let's focus on handling the `None` values during DataFrame creation and cell normalization, and use `map` for normalization.\n",

    "The previous code successfully extracted tables and handled most errors, but the `UserWarning` about non-unique columns when converting to a dictionary persists. While `to_dict('records')` handles this by keeping the last occurring column with a duplicate name, it's better practice to ensure unique column names before conversion. A simple approach is to append a suffix to duplicate column names. Also, ensure that the table data is correctly appended to the existing `page_info` list for each page, not overwriting it. The current code re-initializes `page_info` for each document, which is incorrect. Let's fix this and handle duplicate column names.\n",

    "*   The initial attempt to iterate through PDF documents failed because the specified directory did not exist. Creating the directory resolved this.\n",
    "*   The first attempt at page-level processing using previously opened document objects failed because the objects were closed. Re-opening documents and loading pages individually resolved this issue.\n",
    "*   The heuristic for identifying potential headings based on font size and position yielded limited and not always accurate results for the sample documents.\n",
    "*   OCR was successfully implemented for pages with non-selectable text based on a heuristic of empty or short extracted text.\n",
    "*   Text cleaning functions were implemented to normalize whitespace and handle hyphenation artifacts.\n",
    "*   Table detection and extraction using `pdfplumber` were implemented, including normalization of cell content and handling of potential `None` values.\n",
    "*   A function to make table column headers unique was successfully implemented to avoid issues during DataFrame conversion to dictionary format.\n",
    "*   A basic natural-language summary was generated for each extracted table, including dimensions and sample column names.\n",
    "*   Image detection and extraction using PyMuPDF were successful, with images saved to temporary files.\n",
    "*   A simple rule-based image classification based on dimensions and aspect ratio was implemented.\n",
    "*   Image metadata, including size, classification, and page number, was successfully annotated. An attempt to find the image bounding box on the page was made but noted as a potentially inaccurate simplified approach.\n",
    "*   The final structured output successfully combined the extracted text blocks, potential headings, tables, and image metadata for each document and page into a nested dictionary format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Improve the heading detection logic by exploring more robust methods beyond simple font size heuristics, potentially involving analysis of the document's structure or a Table of Contents if available.\n",
    "*   Enhance the image classification by integrating a more sophisticated model or library capable of identifying specific types of images, such as charts, figures, or photographs, potentially using ChartOCR for chart-specific analysis.\n"

    "The previous command failed because the `whisper` library installed via `pip install whisper` is not the OpenAI Whisper model. The OpenAI Whisper model is available through the `openai-whisper` package. Additionally, the PyPDF2 embedded file access is still incorrect; for older versions it was `reader.attachments`, for newer versions `reader.embedded_files`. The traceback suggests an older version might be in use or there's another issue with accessing embedded files. Given the inconsistencies and potential version issues with PyPDF2 and embedded files, and the incorrect Whisper package, the best approach is to install the correct OpenAI Whisper package (`openai-whisper`) and acknowledge that embedded audio extraction from PDFs without attachments is complex and not fully supported by standard libraries. The code will focus on the transcription part using the correct Whisper package, but the audio extraction from PDFs will remain limited to checking for attachments using a more robust method if available or noting the difficulty. Let's try to install `openai-whisper` and update the PyPDF2 part based on typical usage.\n",
